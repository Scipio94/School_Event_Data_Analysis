# School Event Data Analysis

## **Introduction** 

Across the school network the percentage of ‘Hispanic or Latino’ and ‘Not Hispanic or Latino’ student population is almost equal as is the percentage of families that prefer to receive school wide communications in Spanish and English. The goal of this project is to analyze the attendance data collected from a school event, and based on the data  analysis make inferences about how to increase the efficacy of outreach efforts to increase student attendance at the next school event .Within the dataset there are several variables that will have a significant effect on the outcome:
- Language Communication Preference
  - English 
  - Spanish
- Ethnicity
  - Hispanic or Latino 
  - Not Hisponaic or Latio
  - Not Specified
- School Campus
  - Primary School (PS) : Grades K-2
  - Intermediate School (IS): Grades 3-5
  - Middle School (MS): Grades 6-8
  - High School (HS): Grades 9-12
- Attendance 
  - Attended 
  - Did Not Attend

## **Objective**

Provide data analysis of dataset to strategize outreach to drive student attendance at the next school sponsored event. The analysis will be guided by the following questions:

1. What is the student population at each campus?
2. What is the demographic information of the students enrolled in the school network?
3. What is the demographic information of each campus?
4. What percentage of students were present at the events ?
5. What was the demographic information of the students that attended the event?
6. What was the demographic information of the students that attended the event at each campus ?
7. What were the language preferences of the students that attended the events at each campus?

## **Conclusion** 

Based on the analysis the following conclusions  have been made:

- A vast minority of student enrolled in the school network, 394 (38%), attended the event
- HS, the campus with the most enrolled students, 282,  had the lowest student attendance, 70 (18%) at the event..
- The ratio of students identifying as  ‘Not Hispanic or Latino’ to  students identifying as ‘Hispanic or Latino’ enrolled in the school network is nearly 1:1. This ratio isn’t reflected in the demographic information of the students that attended in the event where the ratio of students that identifying as ‘‘Not Hispanic or Latino ’ and the students identifying as ‘Hispanic or Latino’ is nearly 1.2:1
- The MS campus had the highest percentage turnout, 67%, of students that identified as ‘ Not Hispanic or Latino’ out of all the campuses, but had a lower than expected turnout in student attendance at the event.
- The PS campus had the largest turnout of families that preferred to receive school communication of both Spanish and English.
- The PS campus had the most students attend the event, 124 (31%), in the school network.
- The HS campus had the lowest turnout of families that preferred to receive school communication of both Spanish and English. 
- The HS campus had the least students attend the event, 70 (18%), in the school network.



# Suggestions

1. There should be an increase in outreach to families that speak both Spanish and English at all campuses in the school network to increase family engagement and student attendance for the next event.
2. There needs to be focus on outreach to families that prefer to receive school communications in Spanish at both the MS and HS campuses. Both campuses have a significant percentage of their student population identify as ‘Hispanic or Latino. However, this percentage is not reflected in the  demographic information of the students in attendance at the event.
